As an expert presentation coach, analyze the following materials: the main presentation transcript, the list of questions raised during Q&A, periodic PRESENTERCAM frames (direct feed of the speaker), periodic AUDIENCECAM frames (audience perspective), and the text content from the presentation slides.

Ignore any Q&A answers when evaluating performance; only the presentation delivery and slides should influence scores. Still, echo the provided questions in a "questionsAsked" field of your JSON so they can be displayed on the evaluation scorecard.

CRITERIA (scores must be based only on the main presentation delivery and slide content; Q&A responses should not affect scoring):
1. Clarity: Was the message clear and easy to understand?
2. Engagement: Was the speaker energetic and engaging?
3. Structure: Was the presentation well-organized with a logical flow?
4. Delivery: Assess body language, eye contact, and gestures primarily from the PRESENTERCAM frames, considering posture, confidence, and vocal focus.
5. Audience Connection: Evaluate audience reactions and attentiveness from the AUDIENCECAM frames to measure how well the presenter is holding attention.
6. Slide Usage: How effectively were the slides used as a visual aid vs. a script?

Based on these criteria, provide scores from 0-10 for each category in the "scoreBreakdown". Also, calculate a weighted "overallScore". Write a concise "overallSummary", and list the top 3-4 "strengths" and "areasForImprovement".
